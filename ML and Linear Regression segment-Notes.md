#linear Regression description

We first imported all of the dependencies the analysis needed to run smoothly and then read the data through the data frame. We are focusing on the Revenue of the movies and the budget on how they correlate with the release date. Based on the findings we can tell which movie made the most money based off when it was released. The first chart is the scatter plot showcasing the data based on the revenue and budget. The variables were set as x=Budget and y =Revenue. The second chart presents use the linear regression line to help show the relationship between the revenue and budget. Based on the results we ran a regression score and it came to be .55 which is far off from 1.0. 

#Machine Learning description

The first task is to import all dependencies that will analyze, learn the data, test the data, and plot the results. the variables that the code will be training and analysising is x= Release date and y= revenue. The machine learning model that will be used is Supervised learning. We are going to train the variables and run random forest model code to create many decision trees. These decisions will determine what we should trust based on the tree value and showcase the best data and positive outcomes within the movie entertainment world. Our code will randomness each tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree. The next test the machine learning will conduct is a decision tree to help identify a strategy most likely to reach our conclusion on what movies made the most based on the released data. Through training the variables x (revenue) and y (release date) decision tree will cyle through the data and come up with the analysis and give the result that should be communicated to our shareholder.
