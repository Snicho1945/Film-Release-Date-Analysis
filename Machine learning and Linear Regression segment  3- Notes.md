Linear Regression Analysis description

We first imported all of the dependencies the analysis needed to run smoothly and then read the data through the data frame. Chart  #1 We are focusing on the Revenue of the movies and the budget on how they correlate with the release date. Based on the findings we can tell which movie made the most money based off when it was released. The first chart is the scatter plot showcasing the data based on the revenue and budget. The variables were x=Budget and y =Revenue. The second chart presents to use the linear regression line to help show or the relationship between the revenue and budget. Based on the results we ran a regression score and it came to be .55 which is far off from 1.0

Cahrt #2 we are focusing on the Revenue of the movies and month the movie came out to see how they correlate with easch other.Based on the findings we can tell which movie made the most money based off the month it was released. The first chart is the scatter plot showcasing the data based on the revenue and month. The variables were x=Month and y =Revenue. The second chart presents to use the linear regression line to help show or the relationship between the month and budget. Based on the results we ran a regression score and it came to be 

Chart # 3we are focusing on the Release time during holiday and the revenue earn during months November and december versus any other time of the year.  Based on the findings we can tell how well movies did during the holiday. The first chart is the scatter plot showcasing the data based on the variable holiday  and revenue. The variables were x=Holiday and y =Revenue. The second chart presents to use the linear regression line to help show or the relationship between the variable holiday and Revenue. Based on the results we ran a regression score and it came to be 


Machine Learning Analysis File description

The first task is to clean the data. We clean the data frame to fit the machine learning model. What we are looking to clean is the data to eliminate skewness and replace missing values and only keep the columns that will help answer the question at hand. As the data frame was created it represents a live environment of the data frame. In the analysis, we clean the data to be showcase fair results and showcase values even if the original value was not presented and we replace the value with a zero. So we clean the data all the way through.

The engerring porcess of this machine learning is to clean the data to what we want repersent within the model and let random forest to make multiple tree off of the set data in the test we create in part 1 and part 2. After conforming the trees we will the insert descision tree to caculate and make a summary. Based off the results we can then run the code through a analysis and showcase the data and how it perform and what rating, revenue, and title perform will during its relaese date. This will show what movie title did the best and made the most money.

We will splilt the the training set into two parts. We will train the the data set to look at the release date which is the x variable and let the y variable be revenue. In the next test we wil test the x variable genre and y being the revenue. This will give use the clear sense of of what movie is making money base off of release date and which genre is more popurlar during the the time of release.

# Segment 1 and 2 

The next step is to import all dependencies that will analyze, learn the data, tet the data, and plot the results. The variables are will be presented in the code are x= Release date and y= revenue and we will put this in the code to train through the data within the machine learning model. The machine learning model that will be used is Supervised learning. Within the machine learning model, the variables will go through two test models random forest and decision trees. The random forest will create many decision trees. Our code will then be randomness through each tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree. The positives in why we choose this model is due to its ability runs efficiently on large databases and it is has a highly accurate classifier. What the team has to watch when using random forest is not to allow the model to run slow because of the code and if the code runs slow the result not able to produce real-time predictions. What you need to truly think of Random forest is it is a predictive modeling tool and not a descriptive tool. The next model test the machine learning will conduct is a decision tree to help identify a strategy most likely to reach our conclusion on what movies made the most based on the released date.The good thing about using a decision tree is that it forces the consideration of all possible outcomes of a decision.Which then maps and then traces out each path to a conclusion. Then it helps creates a comprehensive analysis of the consequences along each branch and identifies decision nodes that need further analyses. The only downside is if a small change could not allow the process of the analysis. The overall decision tree is very unstable and you must have the data frame prepared or the results will be the code will not run.

# Segment 3 Notes

For the final project we steered away from descision tree and random forest which was the direction the team wanted to test the models in the machine model. The new direction in which we will but the models in will be cross viladation and neural network models. Model 1 and model 2 will ran with cross viladation which is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models. The pros of using cross viladation is easy to understand, easy to implement, and results in skill estimates that generally have a lower bias than other methods. The negative side of using this model is that with using Cross Validation the user drastically increases the training time of the model. Earlier you had to train your model only on one training set, but with Cross Validation you have to train your model on multiple training sets. Model 3 we will be using nueral network to focus the machine learning base on the genres and how revenue effect the succes of the genres in our data frame. Nueral network model  is a computational learning system that uses a network of functions to understand and translate a data input of one form into a desired output, usually in another form. The pros of using Nueral network is it has the ability to learn by themselves and produce the output that is not limited to the input provided to them. The input of the network is stored in its own networks instead of a database, hence the loss of data does not affect its working. The downside of using this type of machine learning is that it usually require much more data than traditional machine learning algorithms, as in at least thousands if not millions of labeled samples. This isn't an easy problem to deal with and many machine learning problems can be solved well with less data if you use other algorithms.

# Model scores and how they relate to our test variable


The data collected in model 1 which looks into the columns in the data frame and test it through the variable revenue. The regression score is 0.5430834757292722 which is a postive result. The results when the lasso test running is .5423760475256304 which is close to the regression score and the ridge score is 0.5492908370454095. When combining the two and run the elastic net we and we get 0.4731431344863092. All test results are in the same ball park. We can detrimine the revenue can not soley predict the success of the outcome of the movie.

Model two focuses on the variable month and how revenue may effect the success. The regression score is 0.00140294244387984. Though this is a postive interger. We note that this score is less than one and that the month of year truly can not show much how success the movie recieves in revenue.

Model three which is the variable genres and testing how revuene play the regression score is 0.00140294244387984. The lasso score is 0.018623876691926555. Noting that both less than 1 percent the genre still is not a major factor in the succes of the movie.

Dataframe Visual File

This file was created to read the data frame and showcase a couple of graphs that will paint the picture of the data. In the file, the reader will see bar graphs and scatter graphs. The bar graphs showcase important column trends that we as a team would like to highlight. the heatmap is showcasing the trends within the statics of the data. Lastly, the scatter chart shows the relationships of the columns that are important for answering the research question.
