## Outline of the project
We are using Postgres database hosted on AWS.  We plan to use linear regression and Decision Tree predictor. Please see our presentation document for a fuller explanation.

## Release Date for Movies based on Machine Learning
The purpose of this collaboration project is to determine the optimal release dates for movies based on the time of year and genre.
This information could help the entertainment industry maximize gains made from movies as well as be an important tool for independent studios lacking a big budget.
