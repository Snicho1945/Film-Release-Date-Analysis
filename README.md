## Segment 2
- The **Presentation** is a work-in-progress that is being updated as the project changes and grows.

- **Machine Learning** 
Data Analysis:  We are using movie data to determine the optimal release dates for movies based on the time of year and genre. This information could help the entertainment industry maximize gains made from movies as well as be an important tool for independent studios lacking a big budget. The machine learning model will be utilizing is random forest and decision tree within the scope of supervised learning. 

- **Dashboard**
Creating visuals using Tableau Public. Work in progress. Will get with team members to decide what graphs will be needed.

The X variable is release _date and the y variable is revenue. With decision tree, we are building the foundation to create our random forest model. When we use the random forest model, we will be coSnstructing a multitude of decision trees that will reflect revenue versus release date to predict the individual trees. With that information we will see movie performance trends based on the analysis results through machine learning.

 - **Dashboard** 
- Tableau will used for the dashboard 
- Mosaic chart depicting studio revenue and picture count
- Graphs depicting movie success by release date with genre
- Breakdown of graphs from ML with descriptive text
- World maps showing a ranking of countries with revenue and movie count, separated
- Scatter plot with regression
- Outliers
- Distribution pie chart 5-10
- Another scatter plot and regression by genre
- Synergy graphs need to complement each other



## Outline of the project
We are using Postgres database hosted on AWS.  We plan to use linear regression and Decision Tree predictor. Please see our presentation document for a fuller explanation.

## Release Date for Movies based on Machine Learning
The purpose of this collaboration project is to determine the optimal release dates for movies based on the time of year and genre.
This information could help the entertainment industry maximize gains made from movies as well as be an important tool for independent studios lacking a big budget.

## Dashboard
Creating visuals using Tableau Public. Work in progress. Will get with team members to decide what graphs will be needed.
